# wxwidgets-template

This is a super clean template I created in CLion to have a starting point using wxWidgets.
It just creates a blank window with a title, nothing else. Just press build and it will run.

The reason was I couldn't find any good starting points with a clean structure of header files and source files when I started to use wxWidgets.
I just needed a really clean and simple template.
It has a basic folder structure with HeaderFiles and SourceFiles folders.

It was created especially for Mac.

CLion version: 2022.1.1
OSX Monterey 12.3.1 

The easiest way to start and have it running on Mac is to use it with homebrew.
1. brew install wxwidgets
2. clone or download this repo.
3. run (if you are using CLion.

It creates a simple window with CMake. All is explained in the CMakeLists.txt
